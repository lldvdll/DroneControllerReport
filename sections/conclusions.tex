\section{Conclusions}

REINFORCE lacks both training stability and fine credit assignment to control the planar drone, and requires additional mechanisms to manage variance. With targeted binning, SARSA is capable of outperforming a physics-based controller with better path finding and speed, demonstrating superior control. Both approaches benefit from responsive reward design and curriculum learning.
