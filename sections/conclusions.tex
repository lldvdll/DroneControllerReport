\section{Conclusions}

Though both approaches benefit from responsive reward design and curriculum learning, REINFORCE lacks both training stability and fine credit assignment to control the planar drone, requiring additional mechanisms to manage variance. With strategised binning, SARSA is capable of outperforming a physics-based controller, exhibiting superior control through learned path optimisation and safety awareness.
