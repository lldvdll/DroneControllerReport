We develop autonomous controllers for an underactuated planar drone sequential target navigation subject to hard boundary constraints. We compare \textbf{REINFORCE}, a continuous policy-gradient method theoretically offering finer control, with \textbf{SARSA}, a discrete value-based approach prioritising training stability. We demonstrate that while \textbf{REINFORCE} suffers from high variance and optimisation instability, \textbf{SARSA} successfully converges to a robust, boundary-aware policy capable of momentum management in constrained environments.
