The control of unstable dynamical systems, such as quadcopters, presents a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). The state space is continuous, involving non-linear dynamics. This report explores two distinct RL approaches for learning flight control and target acquisition: a discrete value-based method (SARSA) and a continuous policy-gradient method (REINFORCE).
