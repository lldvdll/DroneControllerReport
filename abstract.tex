We develop autonomous controllers for a planar drone performing sequential target navigation subject to hard boundary constraints. We compare \textbf{REINFORCE}, a continuous policy-gradient method theoretically offering finer control, with \textbf{SARSA}, a discrete value-based approach prioritising training stability. We demonstrate that while REINFORCE suffers from high variance and optimisation instability, SARSA successfully converges to a robust, boundary-aware policy.
